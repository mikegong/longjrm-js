Introducing JRM (JSON Relational Mapping) - a dynamic and high efficiency library designed to revolutionize the way databases are populated. Recognizing that the majority of databases don't naturally support object-oriented programming, JRM steps in as a game-changing solution, bridging the gap with finesse and efficiency.

At its core, JRM offers a hybrid adapter, meticulously crafted to facilitate a more seamless and intuitive connection between object-oriented programming (OOP) and various types of databases. This innovative approach circumvents the limitations often encountered with traditional Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in non-object-oriented databases.

JRM's unique JSON Relational Mapping technique stands apart in the landscape of database interaction, offering a more adaptable and efficient way to manage and populate databases across a wide array of applications. Whether you're dealing with legacy systems or the latest database technologies, JRM provides a robust, flexible solution to integrate OOP paradigms into your database management strategy effectively.

This library is a JRM implementation for JavaScript.
